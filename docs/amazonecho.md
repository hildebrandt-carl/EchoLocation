# Setting up the Amazon Dot

This tutrotial will describe how I set up the amazon dot.

## Conencting to the UVA wifi

The first thing we will do is generate a guest pass for the amazon dot. You can get a guest pass by going to the following website:

https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=5d47ecc1db8d1bc4f032f1f51d9619b2

Click:

Get a Short-Term Guest Ready
Guest Passcodes for Wireless Access

Currently we are using the guest code:

```
t6k7mvg
```

This guest code expires on **12-14-2018** at **1:00 AM**.

Now you have the guest code connect to the Welcome_to_UVa_Wireless and use the code.

Use the Amazon Alexa app to connect to the wifi. Follow the instructions in the app to change the wifi access.


## Creating a skill

Log onto the amazon portal and create a developer account

Enter a skill name

Choose a skill name

And select cusotm template

Select Custom

The next thing you need to do is enter a invocation name.

this is the name which will be used to invoke our skill.

Ours is "follow me"

The next thing to do is to create intents and slots
