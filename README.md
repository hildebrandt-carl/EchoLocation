# EchoLocation
This is the final project for Autonomous Mobile Robots course.

Connecting to the server



Running the server
```
node server.js
```

Running the python script
```
python server_conncetion_test.y'
```

Right now this is only tested on python2



# Server

The server is currently running on digital ocean. The servers details are as follows:
```
ssh root@159.65.234.255
password: AMR_Group4
```

## Updating the server

Once the droplet has been created I needed to install the following in order to allow the server to work.
```
sudo apt-get install node-js
```
