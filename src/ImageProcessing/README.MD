# Image Processing

This code takes an image of an Amazon Dot as input. It then converts it to a binary image with only the LED's shown as 1 values in the image. This information is then used to calculate an angle from the center of the image.

## Running the code

Running the code can be done using:

```
$ python echo_direction.py
```

## Prequrequistis

This code requires you have the following packages installed:

* Matplotlib
* OpenCV
* Numpy

Matplotlib and numpy can be installed using pip. OpenCV is slightly more difficult however there is a document in the docs folder describing the whole process.
